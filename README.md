# Moisture Sensor Detection System

## Overview

This project involves building a moisture sensor detection system that collects data from a moisture sensor and sends it to a Firebase database. The collected data can then be processed by an IoT (Internet of Things) application.

## Features
- Wifi Connection
- Moisture sensor data collection.
- Firebase integration for data storage.
- Connectivity with an IoT application for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Arduino IDE (for programming the Arduino board).
- Necessary libraries for the moisture sensor and Firebase integration.
- Firebase account for database setup.
- IoT application for data processing.

## Setup

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the moisture sensor to the Arduino board.
   - Ensure proper power supply and connections.

2. **Arduino Programming:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided sketch.
   - Configure the sketch with your Firebase credentials.

3. **Firebase Setup:**
   - Create a Firebase project and set up a Realtime Database.
   - Obtain the Firebase project credentials.

4. **Configuration File:**
   - Create a configuration file with the necessary parameters (e.g., Firebase credentials).

5. **IoT Application:**
   - Set up your IoT application to connect to the Firebase database.
   - Configure the application to process and visualize the moisture sensor data.

## Usage

1. Upload the Arduino sketch to the board.
2. Ensure the moisture sensor is properly connected.
3. Run the IoT application for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or operation, refer to the following:

- Check hardware connections.
- Verify Firebase credentials.
- Review IoT application configuration.
- Refer to the project documentation for additional troubleshooting steps.
